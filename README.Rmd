control how many times conditions are thrown

docs: https://ropensci.github.io/conditionz/

Package API:

```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA, results="asis"}
cat(paste(" -", paste(sprintf("`%s`", getNamespaceExports("conditionz")), collapse = "\n - ")))
```

Use cases for `conditionz` functions:

- `ConditionKeeper` is what you want to use if you want to keep track of conditions inside a
function being applied many times, either in a for loop or lapply style fashion.
- `handle_conditions`/`handle_messages`/`handle_warnings` is what you want to use if the multiple
conditions are happening within a single function or code block
- `capture_message`/`capture_warning` are meant for capturing messages/warnings into a useable
list

## Installation

The CRAN version:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("conditionz")
```

Or the development version:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ropensci/conditionz")
```

```{r}
library("conditionz")
```

## ConditionKeeper

`ConditionKeeper` is the internal R6 class that handles keeping track of
conditions and lets us determine if conditions have been encountered,
how many times, etc.

```{r}
x <- ConditionKeeper$new(times = 4)
x
x$get_id()
x$add("one")
x$add("two")
x
x$thrown_already("one")
x$thrown_already("bears")
x$not_thrown_yet("bears")

x$add("two")
x$add("two")
x$add("two")
x$thrown_times("two")
x$thrown_enough("two")
x$thrown_enough("one")
```

## basic usage

A simple function that throws messages

```{r}
squared <- function(x) {
  stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
  y <- x^2
  if (y > 20) message("woops, > than 20! check your numbers")
  return(y)
}
foo <- function(x) {
  vapply(x, function(z) squared(z), numeric(1))
}
bar <- function(x, times = 1) {
  y <- ConditionKeeper$new(times = times)
  on.exit(y$purge())
  vapply(x, function(z) y$handle_conditions(squared(z)), numeric(1))
}
```

Running the function normally throws many messages

```{r}
foo(1:10)
```

Using in `ConditionKeeper` allows you to control how many messages
are thrown

```{r}
bar(x = 1:10)
```

```{r}
bar(1:10, times = 3)
```

## benchmark

definitely need to work on performance

```{r}
library(microbenchmark)
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  normal = suppressMessages(foo(1:10)),
  with_conditionz = suppressMessages(bar(1:10)),
  times = 100
)
```
